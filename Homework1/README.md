Problem 1
Use logistic regression with mean squared error loss.

Problem 2
Use logistic regression with binary cross entropy loss.

Problem 3
Load the training and test data using Keras, no validation set needed.
Create network with an input layer consisting of 28 x 28 input neurons and an output layer consisting of 10 output neurons.
Use softmax and categorical cross entropy loss.
Implement mini-batch stochastic gradient descent using only numpy, that is, you are not allowed to use TensorFlow/Keras for SGD.
Problem 4
Reimplement the network from Problem 3 entirely in Keras.

Problem 5
Extend the network from Problem 4 by adding new features.
